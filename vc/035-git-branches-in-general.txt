A. What command shows the branch you're currently on?
git show-branch --current
Above is the commands which can show branches

B.
Create a branch from "master" to "devel". Switch to it. Why
don't you want to work in master?
Work in development branch is sandboxed into the development branch, effectively separating the branches. Only when the work is ready
the work should be pushed into the main to avoid problems. It would be troublesome if a working product would have problems due to maintenance.
This would happpen if everything happened in the main branch.
